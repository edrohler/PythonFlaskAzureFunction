# Python Azure Function

This is an example of an Azure Function written in Python which uses Flask and Swagger.

It was derived from the [Azure Sample - Flask App on Azure Function](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/flask-app-on-azure-functions/tree/main).

The idea is to create a restful API in Flask and host it on Azure Functions with documentation provided by swagger.
